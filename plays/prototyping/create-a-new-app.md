# Create a new app

Play \#1: use the playbook.

You can generate a new app with all the plays pre-packaged and read to boot.

```sh
npm install -g create-react-app
create-react-app --scripts-version @lostmyname/react-scripts my-app
```

Perfect for setting up a new project or launching a playground to run experiments.
