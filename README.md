# web-playbook

If you want to know how to build something for the world wide web at Lost My Name, this is your guide.

It documents, by example, our key plays (patterns for building web apps) and provides a single unified infrastructure.

This is a living project: the tooling in this repo powers our web applications day to day, and all our architectural patterns are tried, tested and documented first here - its their canonical home.

## Credits

[create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) - our customised react-scripts package is forked from CRA. The CRA CLI tool is used to build new apps.

[react-universally]() - a great boilerplate from which some ideas were taken, mainly the emojis.
